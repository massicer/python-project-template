# Python Project template

## QuickStart.
This project is useful if you need to start quickly a new `python` project.
It provides a standard folder structure and allowing you to use the [vscode devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) with 
the default custom image defined [here](https://github.com/massicer/python_toolchain)

## ðŸš€ CI/CD
It also provides to you a built `Github Actions` workflow  that uses the same image defined in the `devcontainer`, in order to have
repeatable build.
The pipeline `jobs` that you run on your local machine will have the same behavior as the cloud ones.
